<p>Are you so inspired by progressive candidates running for seats in contested states that you’re going to travel there to help? That’s awesome! We salute you.
<br>
Saving the world can get expensive, what with the cost of gas, flights, hotels, and eating out. That’s why we created this little guide to crowdfunding for your travel expenses. 
<br>
There are many people who want progressive candidates to win, but are unable to leave their homes (whether because of work or family obligations). 
<br>
Let them sponsor your efforts! Follow these easy steps:
<ol>
                  <li>
                  Figure out how much money you’ll need and subtract how much you can afford to pay yourself. That should be your crowdfunding goal.
                  Be sure to include these items:</li>
                  <ol type="a">
                      <li>Gas money or cost of a flight/train/bus to get there</li>
                      <li>Charges for hostels/hotels/AirBnBs you may stay in</li>
                      <li>Some money for the eating out you’ll be doing</li>
                  </ol>
                  <li> Create your project page on <a href="https://funds.gofundme.com">GoFundMe</a> or <a href ='https://www.crowdrise.com'>CrowdRise</a> or <a href='https://fundrazr.com'>FundRazr</a></li>
                  <ol type="a">
                      <li>Use the amount calculated above</li>
                      <li>Add a personal story about why this candidate’s win is important to you and how thankful you will be for people’s support.</li>
                      <li>Add a picture of you, the candidate, or a particular cause</li>
                      <li>Send donation requests to your friends, family, and friends of friends</li>
                      <li>Post on social media (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram) with a link to your page</li>
                      <li>In all cases, talk about WHEN you need the money by</li>
                  </ol>
                  <li>Keep crowdfunding! People need many nudges to remember to donate</li>
                  <ol type="a">
                      <li>Every few days, post on social media about your progress</li>
                      <li>Once a week later send out emails to everyone about your progress and what’s left. Don’t forget to remind them of the importance of the cause.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <li>Go save the world! (Try to keep your costs down by using HillaryBnB or Couchsurfing)</li>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Post photos to social media of you in action and encourage more donations to cover your efforts</li>
                  </ul>
              </ol>
