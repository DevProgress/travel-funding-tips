      <p>Are you so inspired by progressive candidates running for seats in contested states that you’re going to travel there to help? That’s awesome! We salute you.</p>
      <p>Saving the world can get expensive, what with the cost of gas, flights, hotels, and eating out. Crowdfunding can help you raise the money you need to cover your costs.</p>
      <p>There are many people who want progressive candidates to win, but are unable to leave their homes (whether because of work or family obligations).</p>
      <p>Let them sponsor your efforts!</p>
      <p>New to crowdfunding? Don’t worry! We’ve created this easy guide to get you started.</p>
      
      <h2>Set a Goal</h2>
      <p>Figure out how much money you’ll need and subtract how much you can afford to pay yourself. That should be your crowdfunding goal.</p>
      <p>These are some common expenses for volunteers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Travel:</strong> How do you plan to travel to the location where you’ll volunteer? Calculate how much you’ll need to spend on gas money or a plane, train, or bus ticket.</li>
        <li><strong>Lodging:</strong> Where do you plan to stay? Add up how much the hostels/hotels/AirBnBs will cost. Try to keep your costs down by using <a href="http://www.hillarybnb.com/">HillaryBnB</a> or <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.com/">Couchsurfing</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Food:</strong> Figure out how much you will need to pay for three meals a day and other personal expenses (coffee, snacks, extra toothpaste/shampoo, etc.).</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Create a Project Page</h2>
      <p>You can create your crowdfunding page on <a href="https://funds.gofundme.com/">GoFundMe</a>, <a href="https://www.crowdrise.com/">CrowdRise</a>, or <a href="https://fundrazr.com/">FundRazr</a>. When creating your page, follow these guidelines:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>State your fundraising goal</strong> (calculated above)</li>
        <li><strong>Tell your story.</strong> Let supporters know why this candidate’s win matters to you and how thankful you will be for their support.</li>
        <li><strong>Add a photo.</strong> An eye-catching visual will help attract supporters. You can use a photo of you, the candidate, or an image that calls attention to a particular cause.</li>
        <li><strong>Be specific.</strong> Tell supporters exactly how the funds will be used—for transportation, lodging, food, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Set a deadline:</strong> State clearly the date by which you will need the money.s</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Spread the Word</h2>
      <p>Asking for donations can feel intimidating, but it is essential to meeting your fundraising goal.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Send personalized requests.</strong> Email family and friends asking for their support.</li>
        <li><strong>Post on social media.</strong> You can use Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and Instagram to reach a wider circle of acquaintances. Be sure link to your crowdfunding page and ask friends to share your post.</li>
        <li><strong>Send reminders.</strong> People need many nudges to remember to donate. Every few days, post on social media about your progress, and send email updates once a week. Don’t forget to remind potential supporters of why your cause is important.</li>
        <li><strong>Thank your supporters.</strong> And be sure to tell them <strong>why</strong> their donations matter to you. </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Go save the world!</h2>
      <p>Post photos to social media of you in action and encourage more donations to cover your efforts.</p>
